Good day,
 
I am the counsel who has been assigned this file at the Department of Justice.  As counsel for the Minister, I cannot provide you with any legal advice, however your deadlines for service and filing of your Application Record are based on the Rule 9 response you received dated June 20, 2023.  The Respondent has calculated the deadline for service and filing of the Applicant’s Application Record to be due on or before July 20, 2023, however I would recommend you complete your own calculations to ensure you meet the deadlines for any materials you need to prepare, serve and file accordingly. 
 
The Department of Justice did not receive a copy of the letter you sent to the Federal Court on June 8, 2023.  Going forward, if you file anything with the Federal Court, please ensure that you also copy the Department of Justice at torjusticeimmigration@justice.gc.ca.
 
If you have any further legal questions, you may choose to retain legal counsel or contact the Federal Court to ask about the process for self-represented litigants as they relate to your application for leave and judicial review.
 
I look forward to receiving your application record.
 
Kind Regards,
Leanne
